# A to Z writing style guide

These guidelines help us keep our digital content consistent across our products, platforms and services – for all imprints. This guide is primarily for anyone writing customer-facing copy in SN Digital.

If there's a topic we need to cover, or an example that needs updating, talk to Gaynor Burns.

## A
### abbreviations
The first time you use an abbreviation or acronym, explain it in full with the acronym following in parentheses. Then refer to it by capitalised initials.

For example:
<br>
‘You may need to pay an article processing charge (APC). The APC for this article is…’

Do not use full stops in abbreviations: APC not A.P.C.

Do not shorten days of the week or months of the year. Write them out in full. 

### alt text on images
Follow the guidance on the [W3C accessibility website](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/).

### ampersands (&)
Do not use ampersands. Use the word 'and'. 

This is easier for people to read and understand.

### article
Use ‘article’ to refer to the final accepted manuscript (of article format), ready for publication.

Do not use ‘paper’.

### article processing charge
Lower case, no hyphen.

### author
Lower case.

See: [roles](#roles-job-titles)

### autorenewal
No hyphen or dash.

## B
### basket
E-commerce. Ideally, localise to domain.

Cart = American English

Basket = British English.

See: [cart](#cart)

### book processing charge
Lower case. No hyphen.

### British or American English
We  write in British English for all of our digital products and services (except where the users are solely in the US).

To  make it easier to create interfaces that work internationally, try to avoid [words which have alternative American spellings](https://www.oxfordinternationalenglish.com/differences-in-british-and-american-spelling/) where possible.

This does not apply to marketing or corporate communications copy where the team may be writing for a specific audience segment.

### bullet points
You can use bulleted lists to make text easier to read. Make sure that:

- you introduce the list with a lead-in line (for example, ‘Make sure that:’)
- the bullet text makes sense as a continuation from the lead-in line
- you use lower case at the start of the bullet
- you do not use more than one sentence for each bullet - use commas or a dash to expand if you need to

Do not use full stops or semicolons in bulleted lists.

### capitalisation
Use sentence case for headings.

Example:
<br>
‘Your account details’ not ‘Your Account Details’.

Only capitalise words at the front of sentences (sentence case) and proper nouns.

See: capitalisation for [roles](#roles-job-titles)

### cart
E-commerce. Localise to domain if possible.

Cart = American English

Basket = British English.

See: basket

### CC BY
Type of Creative Commons licence. All capitals, no hyphen.

A hyphen is used only if there’s a clause relating to the licence, for example a non-commercial open licence would be ‘CC BY-NC’.

### Creative Commons attribution licence (CC BY)
Upper case on Creative Commons. Lower on attribution licence.

Licence = British English noun

License = British English verb.

Examples:
<br>
- The CC BY licence  is the default licence for all Palgrave Macmillan and SpringerOpen books and chapters.
- For more information on OA licensing options in Springer Nature books and chapters see our [book policies page](https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/book-policies).

### chapter processing charge (CPC)
Lower case, no hyphen.

### check out, checkout
Checkout can be used but only as a noun or adjective.

Use ‘check  out’  for the verb form. Do not hyphenate.

Examples:
<br>
- Creating an account will make it faster to check out next time.
- Use your saved details for a faster checkout experience.
- Go to checkout.

### click

Avoid using 'click' to instruct users to follow a link. 

Instead use 'select'.

Example:

Select your journal.

See: [select](#select)

### click here
Do not use.

See: [link text](#link-text)

### collection (article collection)
Lower case.

### colons and semicolons
Use a colon at the end of a lead-in line to introduce a quote or list.

Otherwise, avoid using colons or semicolons. If you think a sentence needs a colon or semicolon, break it down into shorter sentences.

### contractions
Using contractions can make your writing sound more human and personal.

Examples:
<br>
- you’re
- we’ll
- it’s (it is)

Do not use negative or conditional contractions as they are harder to understand for people who do not speak English as a first language.

Examples not to use:
<br>
- wouldn’t
- don’t
- haven’t

See: [voice and tone](#voice-and-tone)

### corresponding author
Lower case.

### country
Do not use ‘country’ as a label for a dropdown list of locations.

Some countries are not internationally recognised. Some teams may also be using this list to identify sanctioned countries or territories.

Use ‘Country / region’ instead.

### currency
Write currency codes following an amount of money. If you can, introduce the acronym in the text before writing out the amount of money.

See: [abbreviations](#abbreviations)

Do not use currency symbols. Symbols can be hard to scan and read, especially for those with a learning difficulty.

Our most common currencies used are:

- United States Dollar (USD)
- Euros (EUR)
- Great British Pounds (GBP)

Here is a [list of all currency codes](https://www.iban.com/currency-codes).

Example:
<br>
You can only pay in United States Dollars (USD). The cost is 54.67 USD.

Use a decimal point as a separator for dollars and cents. And commas as a separator of threes.

Example:
<br>
1,234,567.89 USD

## D
### dates
Write dates in full to avoid ambiguity.

Use the format: 28 September 2022

For tables, or where space is an issue, use the shortened form, such as Jan, Feb, Mar.

### DOI
Stands for digital object identifier.

Use DOI in its abbreviated form in interface text.

Example:
DOI: 10.3103/S0967091211120151

### double-anonymous
In reference to the peer review process. Lower case, hyphenated.

See: [single-anonymous](#single-anonymous)

### double-blind, double blind
We no longer use ‘double-blind’ or ‘double blind’ in our systems or in messages to our customers when referring to the review process.

Use ‘double-anonymous’ instead.

See: [double-anonymous](#double-anonymous)

### Dr
No full stop.

## E
### eBook
Not ‘Ebook’, ‘EBook’, ‘ebook’ or ‘EBOOK’.

### editor, editor-in-chief, handling editor
See [roles](#roles-job-titles)

### editorial board, editorial board members
Lower case, for generic roles or the board itself. Upper case if referring to a specific board member.

Examples:
<br>
- John is on the editorial board for Journal x.
- John Brown, Editorial Board Member, Journal x

### eg, etc and ie
Latin abbreviations can sometimes be misunderstood or mispronounced by screen reading software. Instead of using ‘eg’ or ‘ie’, write ‘for example’ and ‘that is’  in full.

Do not use ‘etc’. Use ‘for example’ or ‘such as’ or ‘like’ or ‘including’, whichever works best in the specific context.

Example label on a UI form field:
<br>
- Funding source (for example, university or institutional funding)

### email
All one word. No hyphen.

### emails
Follow the guidelines for plain language.

Emails are often read on mobile devices so brevity and a clear focus on the action you want the user to take are critical. Use structure with headings or bullets to allow for quick scanning.

Pay particular attention to your subject line and front-load the important words (for example, the journal title).

See: [salutation (emails)](#salutation-emails), [signature (emails)](#signature-for-system-emails), [linking from emails](#linking-from-emails)

### EPUB
File format for eBooks. Capitalised.

Example (button text): Download EPUB

### exclamation marks
Avoid for UX microcopy or functional text.

## F

### FAQ
Not 'FAQs'.

### file names: PDF, DOC, ZIP
Capitalised. Not ‘.PDF’.

Examples:
<br>
Upload a ZIP file.

We accept manuscripts in the following formats: DOC, PDF, ZIP.

## G
### gold open access, green open access
Lower case.

## H

### hardback
Use 'hardcover'.

### hardcover
One word. Use instead of 'hardback'.

### home

In navigation and breadcrumbs, refer to the home page as 'Home'.

Do not use 'Home page' or 'Homepage'.

### hyphens
Only use a hyphen if a word is confusing without it.

“Hyphens slow online comprehension as words with hyphens take longer to scan. They can make the reader need to stop to unpick meaning.” ([Readability Guidelines](https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/grammar-points/hyphens-and-dashes/#:~:text=Hyphens%20slow%20online%20comprehension%20as,is%20that%20they%20avoid%20ambiguity.))

Use ‘to’ instead of a hyphen in date or time ranges. This makes it easier for screen readers.

## I
### idioms
Avoid idioms as they are harder to understand and translate.

For example, instead of:
<br>
'We will take steps to…’
<br>
Write:
<br>
‘We will begin to…’

### impact factor
Lower case.

### italics

Use italics sparingly to highlight specific terms such as journal titles within paragraph text. They will lose any meaning or emphasis if used too often.

Do not use for headings. This will conflict with heading styles.

Do not create large blocks of italicised text, such as long lists of italicised journal titles. This is hard to read and can be jarring for some users. 

## J
### job titles
See: [roles](#roles-job-titles)

## K

## L
### LaTeX
Note capitalisation. File format commonly used in scientific disciplines including  maths, physics and astronomy.

### legal text
Always use plain language instead of complex legal language.

For example, instead of:
<br>
“I understand that for digital products, Springer Nature may start the performance of the contract before the end of the withdrawal period and I acknowledge that I thereby lose my right of withdrawal”.
<br>
Write:
<br>
“If you have bought a digital product, for example an eBook, you agree to waive your right to cancel after you select 'buy now'. You will be able to access the item immediately  after purchase.”

### licence / license
In British English, licence is the noun and license is the verb.

Examples:
<br>
- A Springer Nature licence is available to academic institutions.
- How to license our journal articles.

### link text
Do not use any of the following (or similar) as link text:

- ‘click here’
- ‘here’
- ‘read more’
- ‘find out more’

They’re not accessible as they cannot be understood out of context.

Make the link text specific and use active language.

Example:
<br>
Read more about [open research](https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research).

### linking from emails
For rich text emails, follow guidance for [link text](#link-text).

For plain text emails, introduce the link with specific and active language.

Example:
<br>
Continue with publishing your article: https://publishing-rights.springernature.com/workflows/1234

### log in, login
Login can be used but only as a noun or adjective.

Use ‘log in’, ‘log out’ for the verb forms. Do not hyphenate.

Examples:
<br>
- You need to log in to update your address.
- If you have forgotten your login details - contact us.

## M
### manuscript
Use ‘manuscript’ to refer to the completed research document that an author submits to us through Snapp or another editorial system. Do not use ‘paper’.

See: [submission](#submission)

### manuscript / submission / article title
Within emails, titles should be displayed within single quotes.

Example:
<br>
We're delighted that your article has been accepted for publication:

'The effects of exercise training on hypertensive older adults'.

### MyCopy
Capital M, capital  C.

## N
### names (on form fields)
Do not use ‘first name’, ‘last name’ for an international audience.

Use:

- ‘Given names’ instead of ‘First name’
- ‘Family name’ instead of ‘Last name’

### numbers
Write numbers in numerals (including 1 to 9), unless they’re part of a common expression where numerals would look odd (like ‘one or two of them’).

## O
### open access, open data, open science
Lower case. Unless it’s part of a proper name.

Example:
<br>
The Open Access Support Centre was set up to help people understand their options for publishing open access.

### OA
Abbreviation for open access.

## P
### PDF
All capitals. Not ‘.PDF’

Example:
<br>
Upload a PDF file.

### peer review
Lower case. No hyphen.

### please
Use sparingly, and only when necessary - especially in UI. Be mindful of the [voice and tone](#voice-and-tone) you’re using when considering this.

### positional or directional language
Do not use. There are accessibility (and device interaction) issues with words such as ‘below’, ‘on the right’, ‘above’.

Examples to avoid:

- Download the report by clicking the box on the right
- Complete the form below
- Select from our list of services on the left
- Scroll down and click the green button

Often directional language is redundant: the design should not need instructions.

Instead of:

‘Select from the options below:’

Write:

‘Select from these options:’

### preprint, preprinting
Lower case. One word, no hyphen.

Example:
<br>
Research Square provides a free preprinting service to all authors.

### pronouns
Using personal pronouns makes our writing more human and conversational (in line with our brand values). Use ‘we’ and ‘you’ to talk about Springer Nature and the customer.

We do not label things ‘my’, for example ‘my details’.

Use ‘your details’, ‘your  address’ in headers if you need to.

Exceptions:

- confirmation checkboxes
- headings phrased as questions

Examples:

- [ ] I agree to the terms and conditions. I understand you may contact me about my purchase.
- How do I find my article’s DOI?

Do not use gendered pronouns, for example: he, him, she, her. If you must use a pronoun, use ‘they/them/their’ instead.

Example:
<br>
Contact the editor if you need help. They can help with any issues.

If possible, try to rephrase your sentence instead.

Example:
<br>
If you need help with any issues, contact the editor.

## Q
### quality check
Lower case. This may change to ‘technical check’ as the preferred term.

### quote marks

**single quotes**

Use single quotes:

- for unusual terms
- when referring to user actions
- for manuscript or article names within emails

Example: Go to your profile page and select ‘Editorial dashboard’.

**double quotes**

Use double quotes in body text for direct quotations.

## R

### register

When asking someone to create an account or register for an event.

Examples:

Log in or register

Register a new account

### roles, job titles
Specific job titles are capitalised, generic roles aren’t.

Example:
<br>
Elizabeth is Editor-in-Chief of journal x. We have many editors-in-chief.

## S
### salutation (emails)

Use: Dear Title First name Last name

### select

Use instead of 'click' when instructing a user to follow a link.

We do not know what device someone is using or how they are using it. 'Select' is more relevant to all situations.

### sign in, sign out
Use ‘log in/out’ instead of ‘sign in/out’.

See [log in](#log-in-login)

### sign up

Use when asking users to give their information in return for a deliverable.

Example:

Sign up to receive our newsletter

### signature (for system emails)

You do not need to put your team name in system emails.

Use:

Kind regards,

Springer Nature

Where it’s important to the user that the journal is identified, it should read:

Kind regards,

Journal of Pharmacology

Springer Nature

### single-anonymous
In reference to the peer review process. Lower case. Hyphen.

Use instead of ‘single-blind’.

### single-blind, single blind
In reference to the peer review process. Do not use, instead use ‘single-anonymous’.

### Snapp
Initial capital only. Not ‘SNAPP’, or ‘snapp’.

Short for Springer Nature’s article processing platform.

### softcover
One word. Use instead of paperback.

### submission
This refers to all the documents and data an author submits through Snapp. This includes the manuscript, related data files and declarations made in the system.

See: [manuscript](#manuscript)

### support

There are many possible ways to direct people to support or help content depending on the context.

Whether they are within the user interface or longer form content, calls to contact support should be:

- brief
- consistent
- active and direct

Examples:

Need help? Contact us

Contact customer service

## T
### terms and conditions
Lower case. Use ‘and’ not ‘&’.

### thank you
Use sparingly and only when necessary – especially on UI. Be mindful of the [voice and tone](#voice-and-tone) you’re using when considering this.

### times
Use the 24 hour clock together with Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) if you are unable to tell which timezone your user is in.

Use a colon (:) between the numbers.

Use ‘to’ instead of a hyphen in date or time ranges. This makes it easier for screen readers.

Examples:
<br>
- We received your submission at 13:24 (UTC).
- Our system will be down for maintenance between 23:59 and 03:00 (UTC)

As the majority of our users will not be in this timezone, add the ability to convert to a local timezone if possible.

Suggestion to improve  accessibility:

Please apply before 16:00 (UTC). [What’s this in my timezone?](https://www.google.com/search?q=13%3A24+UTC)

### transformative journals
Lower case.

## U

## V
### voice and tone
Here are the Springer Nature brand attributes that apply to UX writing, with some tips on how to apply them:

- **friendly**
  - write things as you’d say them out loud (for example: ‘We’ve sent you a security code’ instead of ‘You have been sent a security code’)
  - use positive contractions like ‘you’ll’ instead of ‘you will’
  - say sorry when something has gone wrong  (for example, ‘Sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Try again in a few minutes’)
- **transparent**
  - be specific about what will happen and when (for example, ‘We’ll email you within 24 hours’)
  - make costs clear upfront – there should be no unwelcome surprises
  - avoid or explain acronyms
  - use the active voice to make clear who is doing what
- **simplified**
  - write short sentences (max 25 words)
  - choose easy, conversational words over formal ones
  - avoid idioms that may translate to an international audience
- **confident**
  - be direct and remove unnecessary filler words

**Tone**

We want to sound human and empathetic. Using empathy in writing means being sensitive to the user’s context, particularly in stressful moments.

When it comes to error messaging, payments and transactions, time-based interactions, clarity always comes first.
