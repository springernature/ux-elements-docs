# Writing emails
## While all our rules apply to emails, we also have specific guidance for direct communication with researchers

### Make things as easy as possible for the researcher

Our overriding principle when writing emails is to make things as easy as possible for the researcher. In practice, this means following three principles:

#### 1. See things from the point of view of the researcher

This sometimes means turning things on their head - so that we’re not just thinking about what we want to tell the researcher, but what it is that the researcher wants to know or is expecting to hear from us. Often they simply want to know where they are in the process.

For instance, if we’re emailing an author to confirm that we’ve received their submission, they probably aren’t looking for a lot of warnings about what could happen if they do something wrong.

All they probably want to know is … where they are now … what happens next and how long it will take - without having to scroll through a long email or wade through a lot of detail to find it.

#### 2. Keep emails short and single minded

It’s tempting to imagine recipients reading our carefully crafted emails line by line. However, next time you open a random email from your inbox, take a moment to see exactly what you do. 
 
Research shows that, after quickly scrolling to the bottom to gauge the email’s length, you’re likely to scroll back up and have a quick read of the opening paragraph before skimming the rest. In most cases the reason for writing an email is either to request that a researcher takes an appropriate action or to confirm that that action has now taken place. 

So, for instance, if we’re telling the author that we’ve received their submission or letting them know that they need to make some revisions we should be as concise as possible, including just enough information to 
a)    Provide the researcher with the information they need
b)    To support the process 

#### 3. Emails aren’t the place to cover off lots of policies and general catch-alls

While it can be tempting to throw everything into an email just to make sure we’ve covered ourselves – it doesn’t make for a user-friendly experience. Our aim is to keep things simple and single-minded. 

This means we should start by cutting out the clichés. It can be tempting to fall back on stock phrases when opening and closing emails. However, in most cases, the best solution is simply to remove them and get straight to the point. A good example is the commonplace greeting, ‘We hope this email finds you well’, which can sound empty and meaningless.

The same goes for using a standard closing such as, ‘We look forward to hearing from you soon’. If we need to hear from someone soon, it’s far better to be as specific as we can and to say it up front.

### Keep subject lines short

StoA (Submit to Accept) automated emails are sent from the following addresses: stoa-support@springernature.com and do-not-reply@springernature.com.  So, to make sure recipients can instantly see the journal title in their mailbox, we need to add it to the subject line as follows:

Subject line: Scientific Reports: Your submission to our journal

The above subject line is 50 characters. Bear in mind that an iPhone only shows the first 40 characters when an email arrives in someone’s mailbox, so it’s important to to include the most important part of the message within the first 40 or so characters). 

> Tip: Don’t include ‘Confidential’ in subject lines as the emails are likely to end up in the recipient’s spam folder.

### Using our no-reply email address

If we’re using the no-reply email address, we should ideally give recipients an alternative method of replying or greeting help within the body of the email. 

### Keep the text clean and uncluttered

The current StoA emails are in plain text, which means we can’t use any formatting. However, when possible, journal titles, such as Scientific Reports, should be italicised. Other formatting should be kept to a minimum, keeping the text clean and uncluttered.

### Keep bullet points consistent

Bullet points can be a useful way of making complex items easier to grasp and drawing attention to important information. 
To make sure they work effectively: 
* Put your important points first
* Try to be brief and to the point
* Keep the structure the same for each bullet
* Make each line roughly the same length
* Try not to include more than 5 points

Keeping the structure the same means making sure each bullet point starts with the same part of speech (usually a noun or a verb) and that they are all either fragments or complete sentences. Complete sentences should include full stops. Fragments don’t generally need them. 

Avoid repeating the same word(s) at the beginning of each bullet. Try putting them into an introductory line instead, followed by a colon. 

For StoA plain text emails, we start each bullet with a black dot (not asterisks or unfilled circles).

### Use British English rather than American English

If you’re using Microsoft Word, you can set the spell checker to British English by clicking on Tools, Language, English (UK). For Google Docs, go to File, Language, English (United Kingdom). For an existing document, make sure you select all the text before changing the language setting. 

In British English, both -ise and -ize endings are accepted for many words, but we tend to use the -ise ending, as follows:

British | American
----- | -----
apologise   | apologize  
authorise   | authorize  
categorise   | categorize  
criticise   | criticize  
emphasise   | emphasize  
finalise   | finalize  
organise   | organize  
personalise   | personalize  
prioritise   | prioritize  
realise   | realize  
recognise   | recognize  

You can find a comprehensive list of British and American spelling differences here:

One exception is the ‘License to publish’. Here we use the US spelling as it is how most people in the publishing world refer to it.
