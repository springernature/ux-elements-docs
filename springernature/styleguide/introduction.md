# Springer Nature style guide

Think of a style guide as a set of design standards for our brands that define specific elements of the visual language such as color, typography, use of logos and icons etc on our digital platform.

The style guide defines the means we communicate our brand on digital products and aims to encourage consistency of design and messaging to ensure our products are aligned around the brand they represent.
