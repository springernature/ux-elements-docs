## Springer Nature

Welcome to the toolkit for our Springer Nature digital product brand.  

This design toolkit sets the core principles of our creative direction, to help our globally distributed teams build brand-compliant products with a unified, consistent look & feel, that is distinctly Springer Nature.

Springer Nature is a global academic publisher, under which sits a portfolio of flagship brands and imprints, with the aim of advancing discovery and serving the needs of the scientific community. To help add value to the community and build recognition, our brand strategy has identified the need to create publishing solutions directly under the Springer Nature brand name. These are digital products that curate and package content from across our flagship brands and imprints, as well as standalone tools and services.

Our UX Design team has worked collaboratively with Brand and Marketing to adapt our initial marketing design guidelines and extend these for the complex interaction needs of digital product development, allowing the company to grow in this direction.

This toolkit will ultimately provide you with:

- a style guide that defines the Springer digital brand with guidelines on accessibility, layout, typography, ands iconography amongst others.
- a set of components that are used on Springer branded websites that can be consumed or copied for your products
- a set of patterns for common tasks that our users do on our sites. These may be a combination of components and style guidelines

With the help of our frontend team, this design toolkit will evolve to become a living design system of shareable code, ensuring brand consistency and design best practices are effectively applied across the organisation, reducing duplication of effort, for truly efficient product development. Until we are in a position to release shareable code, developers should follow the guidelines laid out in the Frontend Playbook and contact the frontend team for clarification on code decisions.

It is a work in progress and content will be added continuously. If you wish to contribute to any of the style guide, components or patterns, or just want some more information please contact elements@springernature.com.
