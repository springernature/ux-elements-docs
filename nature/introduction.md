# Nature Portfolio


Nature Portfolio is here to serve the research community by publishing its most significant discoveries - findings that advance knowledge and address some of the greatest challenges that we face as a society today. Our journals publish primary research, reviews, critical comment, news and analysis.

This toolkit will ultimately provide you with;

- Our styleguide guidelines on accessibility, layout, typography, and iconography amongst others
- Components that are used on Nature Portfolio branded products that can be consumed or copied for your products
- Patterns for common tasks that our users do on our sites. These may be a combination of components and style guidelines
- Guidance on how to write content that is more conversational and concise for our audiences.


It is a work in progress and content will be added continuously. If you wish to contribute to any of the styleguide, components or patterns, or just want some more information please contact elements@springernature.com.

## Design Principles

The Nature brand stands for the very best in scientific information.
In keeping with our scientific mission, our design system is based on rational information design principles.

Design principles that will help drive the future development of sharable design patterns for all our product teams and customers:

### Simple
We aim to reduce everything to the essential. Every element on our pages should be supporting the needs and goals of our users. These goals vary from wanting to discover relevant content, to finding information that will help them decide whether to submit to the journal.

### Monochromatic
We communicate principally in black and white. Colour can be used as an accent, such as the journal’s identity or to help guide the eye to new information and policy messages. Colours are secondary, never dominant.


### Logical
Our aim is clear and direct communication. Style, scale and positioning of elements should always reflect the information hierarchy. Pages should be structured in level of importance to our audiences, with clearly identifiable sections and prominent navigation.

### Asymetrical
Asymmetrical layout helps us direct the viewer’s eye around the content. Using space and composition, we can support key information and make content more scannable.

### A system-based approach
Grids are the foundation of a logical and systematic approach to layout. They enable us to apply consistency and rationality across a wide range of formats and media.
