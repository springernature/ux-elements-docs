# Inclusive language
 
## Inclusive language simply means using language in a way that expresses respect and openness towards individuals and groups and avoids terms or assumptions that hurt or exclude people.

### Avoid gendered pronouns

One of the main ways we can employ inclusive language is to avoid using gendered pronouns, which automatically assume there are only two genders and do not account for all gender identities. In practice this means using the personal pronoun ‘they’ or ‘their’ instead of saying ‘he or she’ / ‘his or her’ or using he/him as a default to signify all genders.

### Non-native English speakers

We should always be aware of the problems non-native English speakers may have in understanding us. Common idioms, such as, ‘testing the waters’ or ‘striking a balance’, may be self-explanatory if you’re fluent in English, but can be difficult if you’re a non-native speaker.

### Confusing words

Based on usability testing, benchmarking sessions and treejack testing, we’ve noticed that there are some words that can come across as unclear to our users, particularly those who are non-native English speakers. Here’s a list of what they are now and how we may be able to address them:

Word / Phrase | Where can it be found | How it's being interpreted | Problems this can cause | How will we resolve it
:------------ | :---------------------|:---------------------------|:------------------------|:----------------------
Supplementary information | It’s part of the author’s instructions                | Through translation, it could mean "additional information" | Users might assume any other information they can’t find can be found under that heading vs. the supplementary information that they need to attach with their submission
Journal metrics           | Journal websites                                      | People have interpreted metrics as “shares"                 | Journal metrics is one of the most searched for pieces of information. If they don't recognise metrics, the important information is lost | On Springer, it's exposed on the homepage so people recognise that journal metrics is related to metrics they're looking for.
Subscription              | Where a journal can describe it's publishing model    | It's close to the phrase "Subscribe"                                                                                                      | Users might assume there might still be a form of payment required in the submission due to the way the word is phrased. 
Data                      | In various locations on our journal sites             | It's way too vague and it doesn't truly describe much.      | People might not realise that any info related to data might be in that bucket. It could mean any kind of data. We should be clear in labelling if it's an action or not associated with it. e.g. Submitting your data (though sometimes people think of looking at Supplementary info for this)
